### Overview

The `lterpalettefinder` package (LTER + Palette + Finder) was initially developed simply to house hexadecimal code color palettes manually extracted from photos taken at Long Term Ecological Research sites. During its development its purpose expanded to include a set of tools for automatically extracting those colors and visualizing the derived palettes.

This vignette describes the main functions of `lterpalettefinder` and demonstrates one possible use of its workflow from the extraction of a palette from a picture to the visualization of that palette.

```{r setup}
library(lterpalettefinder)
```

### Start with a Picture
<img src="lyon_fire.png" align="right" width="20%"/>

The `lterpalettefinder` workflow begins with a picture from which you'd like to extract hexadecimal codes for the main colors ("main" is defined later). This vignette will use this picture of a prescribed fire in Iowa in 2018 (credit: Nick J Lyon) to allow for easy visual comparison between the source photo and the palette returned by the functions described below.

### Extracting the Palette

The primary function of this package is `palette_extract` which accepts the name and/or path to the image file in your working directory. This function also includes an optional progress bar that is switched off in the example below

```{r palette_extract}
fire_palette <- palette_extract(image = "lyon_fire.png", progress_bar = FALSE)
```

The returned palette always contains the 25 most different colors (as identified by k-means clustering on the red, green, blue bands extracted from the image) stored as hexadecimal codes.

```{r palette-format}
fire_palette
```

### Viewing the Palette

In our experience, few people can look at a string of hex codes and instinctively interpret those as colors, so this package includes `palette_demo` and `palette_ggdemo` to demonstrate the extracted palettes. While there are some aesthetic differences between the plots produced by the two functions the fundamental difference is that `...demo` creates a base R plot while `...ggdemo` produces a `ggplot2` plot. Additionally, `palette_demo` includes built in export options if desired

```{r palette_demo, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.align = "center"}
palette_demo(palette = fire_palette, export = FALSE)
```

```{r palette_ggdemo, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, fig.align = "center"}
palette_ggdemo(palette = fire_palette)
```


### Organizing the Palette

You can also organize the colors into an order that approximates how human eyes instinctively group colors using `palette_sort`. The sorting isn't perfect, but it is far easier to view similar colors than the random order returned by `palette_extract`

```{r palette_sort, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, fig.align = "center"}
fire_sort <- palette_sort(palette = fire_palette)
palette_ggdemo(palette = fire_sort)
```

If desired, `palette_extract` does include a `sort` argument (defaults to "FALSE") that can be activated. That said, it does take marginally longer to compute (~0.5 seconds) the sorting so if running `palette_extract` iteratively it will be faster to leave `sort = FALSE` until color sorting is necessary.

### Simplifying a Palette

It may be the case that you'd want fewer than 25 colors from a given image but don't want to have to go through and manually select the ones you want. `palette_subsample` randomly selects the desired number of colors from a vector of hexadecimal codes for just such an occasion! It also allows you to se the random seed internally for reproducibility

```{r palette_subsample}
fire_sub <- palette_subsample(palette = fire_palette, wanted = 5, random_seed = 42)
palette_ggdemo(palette = fire_sub)
```

### Using a Pre-Built Palette

The original impetus for `lterpalettefinder` was to allow users to select pre-set palettes and while the package has evolved beyond that, `palette_find` does serve this purpose. `palette_find` allows users to specify the site, number of colors, type of palette (e.g., sequential, diverging, etc.), and--if known--the name of the palette to identify and return an official palette.

```{r palette_find}
official_palette <- palette_find(name = "hike")
palette_ggdemo(palette = official_palette)
```

### Looking Ahead

If you have ideas for other functions that `lterpalettefinder` could contain, post them as [a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/lter/lterpalettefinder/issues) and we'll review them as soon as possible!
